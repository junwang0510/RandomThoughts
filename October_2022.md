`Is MAANG still worth it for SDE?`

Yes

- Buying the dip -- big tech companies are unlikely to experience economic depression and can expect a rebound in stock prices, leading to potential financial gains.
- Safer Job Position -- Less likely to layoff employees compared to smaller tech companies.
- Prestige âˆ§ Environment -- Pretige and the opportunities to work with talented SDEs remain unchanged.

`P = NP?`

IDK. Surrounded by talented individuals at UW, I know enough about what I don't know. For security reasons, I wish that P != NP because the world does not yet know how to handle the potential problems caused by P = NP.

`Bomb Lab`

Defused the binary bomb consecutively for the past 12 hours. Didn't really understand some of the later phases so I brute forced through them. However, for the sake of learning, I will attempt to defuse the bomb (ideally a new one) without any tips. Most importantly, I hate GDB.

`Bomb Lab pt2`

Successfully defused all phases (including the secret phase) of the binary bomb. Still, I'm having trouble tracking the arguments to the functions as they move within the stack.

`Trigonometry Tricks`

I learned a neat trick to calculating common trigonometric angle values with my hand. Wish I had known this earlier...
