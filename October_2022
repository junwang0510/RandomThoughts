< Is MAANG still worth it for SDE? > 10/24
Yes
• Buying the dip -- big tech companies are unlikely to experience economic depression and can expect a rebound in stock prices, leading to potential
                    financial gains.
• Safer Job Position -- Less likely to layoff employees compared to smaller tech companies.
• Prestige ∧ Environment -- Pretige and the opportunities to work with talented SDEs remain unchanged.

not yet know how to handle the potential problems caused by P = NP.
