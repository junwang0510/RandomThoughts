< Is MAANG still worth it for SDE? > 10/24
Yes
• Buying the dip -- big tech companies are unlikely to experience economic depression and can expect a rebound in stock prices, leading to potential
                    financial gains.

• Prestige ∧ Environment -- Pretige and the opportunities to work with talented SDEs remain unchanged.
