< Is MAANG still worth it for SDE? > 10/24
Yes
• Buying the dip -- big tech companies are unlikely to experience economic depression and can expect a rebound in stock prices, leading to potential
                    financial gains.
• Safer Job Position -- Less likely to layoff employees compared to smaller tech companies.
• Prestige ∧ Environment -- Pretige and the opportunities to work with talented SDEs remain unchanged.


< P = NP? > 10/24
IDK. Surrounded by talented individuals at UW, I know enough about what I don't know. For security reasons, I wish that P != NP because the world does
not yet know how to handle the potential problems caused by P = NP.


< Bomb Lab > 10/28
Defused the binary bomb consecutively for the past 12 hours. Didn't really understand some of the later phases so I brute forced through them. However,
for the sake of learning, I will attempt to defuse the bomb (ideally a new one) without any tips. Most importantly, I hate GDB.


< Bomb Lab pt2 > 10/29
Successfully defused all phases (including the secret phase) of the binary bomb. Still, I'm having trouble tracking the arguments to the functions as
they move within the stack.


< Trigonometry Tricks > 10/30
I learned a neat trick to calculating common trigonometric angle values with my hand.
