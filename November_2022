< How to get good at anything? > 11/2
While watching Lex Fridman's chat with Andrej Karpathy, I was exposed to the principle of 10000 hours. Karpathy claims that if a person spends 10000 hours
on one subject, he/she will be good at it. Reflecting on this idea, I have realized that some of my most outstanding achievements to this day (Rubik's Cube, 
Cardistry, Magic) is not necessarily the reward of meticulous planning and reflection. Instead, the essential factor for my success in these areas is the 
sheer amount of time I have dedicated to them.

When wire wane, wireless will win. Magsafe might be the future.
