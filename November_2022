< How to get good at anything? > 11/2
While watching Lex Fridman's chat with Andrej Karpathy, I was exposed to the principle of 10000 hours. Karpathy claims that if a person spends 10000 hours
on one subject, he/she will be good at it. Reflecting on this idea, I have realized that some of my most outstanding achievements to this day (Rubik's Cube, 
Cardistry, Magic) is not necessarily the reward of meticulous planning and reflection. Instead, the essential factor for my success in these areas is the 
sheer amount of time I have dedicated to them.

When wire wane, wireless will win. Magsafe might be the future.

"At each increase of knowledge, as well as on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes abridged."


< BEST IDE for Programming > 11/12
I've tried various IDEs over the past year (VS Code, JetBrains's IDEs, Sublime Text, Vim, ...). To me, there is no single best IDE for programming. It depends 
heavily on your goals. If I'm practicing data structures and algorithms, I would prefer to use JetBrains's IDEs because a single language is sufficient. 
However, if I am working on a full-stack school project where I have to work with multiple languages, VS Code is the most convenient one to use. At the 
moment, I am not using Vim a lot as I am navigating the code slower with it due to the lack of practice with key bindings. However, I am planning on using 
Vim Plugins on other IDEs to ease the steep learning curve at the early stage.


< LeetCode Weekly Contest #319 > 11/12
Just finished my 1st LeetCode contest. The questions were easier than I expected and I managed to AC 3/4 problems. I have realized that I'm quite weak at 
Tree problems and subarray questions. On the other hand, I'm comfortable with String parsing.
